XenoLingo is an innovative project with a dual mission: preserving indigenous languages and fostering language learning. This is made possible through the seamless integration of two fundamental components: object detection and a Text-to-Speech (TTS) system for articulate language expression. By harnessing the device's camera, XenoLingo empowers users to recognize real-world objects in real-time. When users point their devices at objects, XenoLingo identifies them and provides labels in both the user's native language script and English, facilitating better comprehension. Additionally, it offers pronunciation through speech. 

## Installation
To get started with XenoLingo, simply install the APK file on your Android device. During the installation process, grant permissions for camera access. Once the installation and permissions are set up, users can begin using the application.
